# A Small Particle Library

The aim of this project is to learn how to apply semi-complex maths in coding.
Much of the inspiration for this library has come from http://www.codingmath.com/.

# TODOS:

1. [ ] Extract the express stuff from this project and move it into particle_docs.
2. [ ] Publish this package to npm and link it in to the particle_docs.
3. [ ] Test to see if the package works.

# MVP 

1. [x] Get site running in express.
2. [ ] Allow users to navigate to examples.
3. [x] 90% test coverage on all libraries. 
4. [ ] Write up API documentation for all the libraries.

# Nice to haves

1. [ ] Performant collision detection.
2. [ ] Configurable examples like three.js examples.
3. [ ] Small game example.
4. [ ] React components as examples.
